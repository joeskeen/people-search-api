# People API Documentation

## Running the API

### Prerequisites

The People API uses dotnet core version 3.1. Make sure that you have that version installed before you proceed.

### Requirements

The requirements for the take home web project are as follows:
- It needs to be written in Angular 2+
- It needs to display a search box where a user can search for people to display in a list
    - The search term should include users where any part of their name matches, e.g. a search term of "bob" would return the user "Jimbob Cooter"
    - Display the list in a pleasing manner where we can see all of the user's information
- It needs to provide the ability to create and edit users
- It needs to provide the ability to slow down the network requests and have the UI handle the delay gracefully

In addition, the app needs to have any 2 of the following:
- [Reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms)
- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)
- [Cashmere](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/)

**Changes to the backend code are not allowed!**

### Starting the server

Extract the PeopleApi.zip file. Make sure you keep all extracted files intact. From the extracted directory, run
`dotnet assessment.dll`. You should see output similar to the following:

```
